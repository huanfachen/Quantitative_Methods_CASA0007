The below data are taken from onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501:

- data_height_handspan.csv
  - Measurements from  167 adults
  - We will check  whether height (x) can be used to explain handspan (y) by means of a linear relationship. 
  - This data could  also be separated into male and female subsets, and each analysed separately
- data_men_200.csv
  - Winning times of  Olympic men's 200m in the 20th century
  - We will check  whether the year (expressed in years since 1900) (x) can be used to explain  Men's 200m times (y) by means of a linear relationship.
- data_stopping_distance.csv
  - Data from American Automobile Association (Defensive Driving: Managing Time and Space,  1991) 
  - Empirically  determined relationship between stopping distance ( y = distance, in feet) and the speed of a car (x = speed, in miles per hour)
  - We will check  whether speed (x) can be used to explain stopping distance (y) by means of a  linear relationship.
